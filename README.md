# Awesome ChatGPT for Research
This repo includes ChatGPT tools and papers to use ChatGPT better for our research.

**You are welcome to update and improve this repository!!**

While ChatGPT is a valuable tool for writing, it is essential to adhere to community policies, such as those set forth by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). The Program Chairs for ICML 2023 included the following statement in their Call for Papers:

> Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. The Large Language Model (LLM) policy for ICML 2023 prohibits text produced entirely by LLMs (i.e., “generated”).  This does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text. The LLM policy is largely predicated on the principle of being conservative with respect to guarding against potential issues of using LLMs, including plagiarism. The LLM policy applies to ICML 2023. We expect this policy may evolve in future conferences as we understand LLMs and their impacts on scientific publishing better.

### Acting as Grammarly
Please proofread and revise my text for grammar errors. Your task is to provide a detailed review of the text, identifying any grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing that could be improved. Please make specific suggestions on how to improve the text, including corrections to spelling, punctuation, syntax, and word choice. In your response, please explain why each change is necessary and how it improves the overall quality of the writing. Additionally, please ensure that your feedback is clear and easy to understand so that I can easily implement your suggestions.

### Acting as Quillbot
Your task is to rewrite and paraphrase a section of text for a research paper. The section should be clearly identified, and you should provide an updated version that accurately conveys the same meaning as the original while using different words and sentence structures. Please note that your response should maintain the integrity and accuracy of the original text while providing a fresh perspective on its content. Your rewritten section should be clear, concise, and free from errors or inconsistencies in language use.

### Acting as a Reviewer
Your task is to read and summarize a paper, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. Your summary should be concise but comprehensive, providing an overview of the key findings, methods used, and conclusions drawn in the paper. In your analysis of the paper's strengths, you should focus on aspects such as clarity of writing, soundness of methodology, relevance of research question or hypothesis, and contribution to existing knowledge in the field. In your analysis of the paper's weaknesses, you should identify any limitations or shortcomings in the study design or execution that may have affected the validity or generalizability of the results. You should also consider potential biases or confounding factors that may have influenced the findings. Please note that your response should be flexible enough to allow for various relevant and creative strengths and weaknesses. However, it should maintain a clear structure and focus on accuracy while encouraging creativity.
